# Diversifier

> An LLM-based agent that performs automated library substitution in containerized projects while maintaining functional equivalence through rigorous testing.

## Why Diversifier?

In modern software deployment, **monoculture vulnerabilities** pose significant risks. When all instances of an application use identical dependencies, a single vulnerability can compromise the entire deployment. Diversifier addresses this through **automated software diversity** - a proven cybersecurity strategy.

### 🛡️ Security Through Diversity

**The Monoculture Problem:**
When your entire Kubernetes cluster runs identical containers with the same vulnerable library (e.g., a compromised HTTP client or JSON parser), attackers can:
- Exploit the vulnerability across all pods simultaneously
- Achieve complete service compromise with a single attack vector
- Bypass traditional security measures that assume attack diversity

**Diversifier's Solution:**
Generate functionally equivalent application variants using different libraries, enabling:
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: Different libraries have different vulnerability profiles
- **Blast Radius Limitation**: Exploits affect only a subset of your deployment
- **Rapid Incident Response**: Shift traffic to unaffected variants during security events

### 🎯 Moving Target Defense (MTD)

Diversifier implements **Moving Target Defense** principles by creating multiple valid targets:

```bash
# Before: Single target for attackers
kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS
api-server-requests-1    1/1     Running  # All use requests library
api-server-requests-2    1/1     Running  # Same vulnerability
api-server-requests-3    1/1     Running  # Same attack vector

# After: Diversified deployment  
kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS
api-server-requests-1    1/1     Running  # Uses requests
api-server-httpx-1       1/1     Running  # Uses httpx (different codebase)
api-server-aiohttp-1     1/1     Running  # Uses aiohttp (async)
```

**MTD Benefits:**
- **Attack Uncertainty**: Attackers cannot predict which library variant they'll encounter
- **Increased Attack Cost**: Requires multiple exploit chains for complete compromise
- **Dynamic Reconfiguration**: Adjust library distribution based on threat intelligence

### 🔀 Software Diversity & Randomization

Diversifier applies established **software diversity techniques** from systems security:

####  **Instruction Set Randomization (ISR) Inspiration**
Just as ISR randomizes instruction encodings to prevent code injection:
- **Library API Randomization**: Different libraries expose different APIs for identical functionality
- **Implementation Randomization**: Varies internal algorithms and data structures
- **Error Handling Randomization**: Different failure modes and exception patterns

#### **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) Parallels**  
Similar to how ASLR randomizes memory layouts:
- **Dependency Randomization**: Varies the dependency graph structure
- **Call Stack Randomization**: Different function call patterns between libraries
- **Resource Usage Randomization**: Different memory and CPU usage patterns

### 🚀 Operational Advantages

**Zero-Downtime Security Response:**
```bash
# CVE discovered in requests library
kubectl scale deployment api-server-requests --replicas=0    # Scale down vulnerable variant
kubectl scale deployment api-server-httpx --replicas=10     # Scale up safe variant
# Service continues with zero downtime
```

**Canary Deployments for Security:**
- Deploy new library variants as canaries
- Test security posture with minimal traffic exposure  
- Gradually shift traffic based on security assessment

**Supply Chain Attack Mitigation:**
- Reduces dependency on single library maintainers
- Distributes supply chain risk across multiple projects
- Enables rapid pivot away from compromised dependencies

### 📊 Threat Model Coverage

| Attack Vector | Monoculture Risk | Diversified Defense |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Library RCE** | 100% compromise | ~33% impact (varies by distribution) |
| **Supply Chain** | Complete takeover | Partial compromise, rapid mitigation |
| **Zero-Day Exploits** | Total exposure | Probabilistic protection |
| **Dependency Confusion** | Full deployment | Limited blast radius |
| **Insider Threats** | Single point of failure | Multiple targets required |

### 🎖️ Industry Alignment

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework:**
- **Identify**: Map library dependencies and vulnerability exposure
- **Protect**: Implement diversity-based protective controls
- **Detect**: Monitor variants for differential behavior
- **Respond**: Rapid incident response through traffic reshaping
- **Recover**: Maintain service availability during security events

**Zero Trust Architecture:**
- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Each library variant operates under same security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Variants can have different permission sets if needed
- **Continuous Verification**: Monitor behavior across diverse implementations

- **📈 Improve Security Posture**: Transition from reactive patching to proactive defense

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Access to your Python project's source code
- Project must have a Dockerfile

### 1. Start MCP Servers

```bash
# Start required MCP servers (from the diversifier repo)
git clone https://github.com/mehrdad-abdi/diversifier
cd diversifier

# Start MCP servers from docker-compose
docker-compose -f mcp-servers/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### 2. Run Migration

```bash
# Example: Migrate from requests to httpx
diversifier /path/to/your/project requests httpx

## Development Strategy

### Phase 1: Python MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
**Scope**: Focus exclusively on Python projects to establish core functionality and prove the concept.

**Target Libraries**: Common Python library substitutions
- HTTP clients: `requests` → `httpx` or `aiohttp`
- Database drivers: `psycopg2` → `asyncpg` or `SQLAlchemy` → `Tortoise ORM`
- JSON processing: `json` → `orjson` or `ujson`
- Logging: `logging` → `loguru`

**Benefits of Python-first approach**:
- Clear dependency management (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml)
- Predictable import patterns (`import`, `from X import Y`)
- Rich ecosystem of functionally equivalent libraries
- Mature containerization practices
- Excellent testing framework support

### Future Phases

Make the tool multi-language based on MVP feedback.
